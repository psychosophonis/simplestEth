## Step by Step demonstration of simple Ethereum blockchain/contract to javascript interactions.

These only require the web3 library that is included in the folder and will run by loading the file directly in the browser.

### Step One: 

A Simple call to local node and accounts via Ethereum Javascript API.

### Step Two: 

Adding a contract call to an existing greeter contract.

### Step Three: 

Replacing local web3 with infuria hosted node and demonstrating form submission to query an address (we no longer have access to our local accounts).

### Step Four:

Metamask to provide nonlocal hosting of accounts to be used with Infuria (To be written).

### Step Five:

Simple Transactions (needs simplifying but wishwell examples currently cover this).
This is an enitre truffle project directory and you will need to use truffle to test it.

### Step Six:

Event and Log interactions (needs simplifying but wishwell examples currently cover this).
This is an enitre truffle project directory and you will need to use truffle to test it.
